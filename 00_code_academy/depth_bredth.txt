Depth first makes a stack and keeps track of visited values. Then it pops values off of the stack, once the stack is empty 
then the algorithm is complete.

Preorder, in which each vertex is added to the “visited” list and added to the output list BEFORE getting added to the stack

Postorder, in which each vertex is added to the “visited” list and added to the output list AFTER it is popped off the stack

Reverse Post-Order (also known as Topological Sort), which returns an output list that is exactly the reverse of the post-order list
